It&#x27;s TikTok&#x27;s differentiation. It updates recommendations within 1 second of you clicking - at human perceivable latency. If your AI recommender has poor feature freshness, it will be perceived as slow, not intelligent - no matter how good the recommendations are.<p>TikTok&#x27;s recommender is partly built on European Technology (Apache Flink for real-time feature computation), along with Kafka, and distributed model training infrastructure. The Monolith paper is misleading that the &#x27;online training&#x27; is key. It is not. It is that your clicks are made available as features for predicitons in less than 1 second. You need a per-event stream processing architecture for this (like Flink - Feldera would be my modern choice as an incremental streaming engine).<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=skZ1HcF7AsM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=skZ1HcF7AsM</a><p>* Monolith paper - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2209.07663\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2209.07663</a>",

Growing up, I had to go to the theater to see movies, but that didn&#x27;t make cliffhangers and sequels any less compelling. Now we binge entire Netflix series and that&#x27;s fine, but short-form video needs government intervention?\nThe real question is: where do we draw the line between protecting people from manipulative design and respecting their ability to make their own choices? If we&#x27;re worried about addictive patterns, those exist everywhere\u2014streaming platforms, social feeds, gaming, even email notifications.\nMy concern isn&#x27;t whether TikTok&#x27;s format is uniquely dangerous. It&#x27;s whether we trust adults to manage their own media consumption, or if we need regulatory guardrails for every compelling app. I&#x27;d rather see us focus on media literacy and transparency than constantly asking governments to protect us from ourselves.<p>You can&#x27;t legislate intelligence...",

There&#x27;s the downright abusive streak management tactics that have become a major part of their brand and PR, and the lesson plans seem designed to plateau to prevent you from actually getting proficient enough in a language to ever unsub. They reset your cleared lessons and require you to redo them if they add new vocab to them, as well as randomly clearing them in the name of making you practice them again. I don&#x27;t know what the solution is but I&#x27;ve known multiple people now who&#x27;ve gotten frustrated and blamed themselves for not being able to advance their skills with a language, but Duolingo&#x27;s business model, like Tinder&#x27;s, is completely opposed with the goals of their users. If Duolingo R&amp;D discovered a magical new method of making you fluent in a language overnight, they would not sell it to you. Tinder R&amp;D might have discovered the actual honest-to-God formula for True Love years ago and burned it because they can make more if you swipe forever.",

Start recommending worse content? How much worse do the recommendations have to be before the EC is satisfied?<p>I agree with you, this is rather odd. And sort of missing the problem.<p>All apps are about attention. The percentage of the time spent using the app when it shows you your good content (Whatever it is that you&#x27;re interested in) determines how addictive it is. And the percentage of time it&#x27;s showing you bad content (Ads, &#x27;screen time breaks&#x27;, manual scroll time, more ads, loading screens, sponsor ads, filler content (youtube for instance is full of this), etc) counteracts the addictive properties because nobody likes it.<p>What&#x27;s the end goal here? Right now TikTok is winning the attention economy race against the other apps because it&#x27;s more focused on the user&#x27;s preferred content. Is that what we want to reduce? To show more uninteresting other stuff on the screen? Like blank &#x27;wait 5 minute&#x27; statics? Or just more ads?<p>I get that we don&#x27;t want a generation of socially inept phone addicts, but this won&#x27;t solve anything I fear. People will still want the good content, forcing the most customer friendly (it feels wrong to say that about TikTok) app to become more enshittified is a bewildering solution.",

On TikTok for example (Not necessarily a fan of the app but it&#x27;s a good example) no videos start with all that empty jabbering you often see on YouTube (&quot;Welcome to my channel...&quot;, &quot;Today we will...&quot;, &quot;Please Like and Subscribe...&quot;, &quot;This video is sponsored by...&quot;, etc), because if they tried any of that crap the viewers would just swipe the content away. So, instead they always get straight to the point. That part is really refreshing.<p>Of course, there are other issues instead.",

Selective application of the law shows this not to be the case and shows that there are other factors in play which decide whether someone - a person, a company, a country - gets to violate some law without legal consequences while someone else is prosecuted for the same violation.<p>If you now think &quot;they have to start <i>somewhere</i> in prosecuting these violations&quot; you&#x27;re partly correct but also partly mistaken. Sure they have to start somewhere but they could - and if they are really serious about their claims <i>should</i> - have started prosecuting all those other companies which did this way before TikTok or even its predecessor Musically was a thing. Algorithm-driven endless scroll designs to keep user&#x27;s eyes glued to the screen have been a thing from very early on in nearly all &#x27;social&#x27; app-site-things and the warning signs about addictive behaviour in users have been out for many years without the law being thrown at the proprietors of those entities. As to why this has not happened I&#x27;ll leave for the reader to decide. There are plenty of other examples to be found in this regard ranging from the apprehension of the Telegram CEO to the sudden fervour in going after X-formerly-known-as-Twitter which seem to point at politics being at play in deciding whether a company gets to violate laws without being prosecuted or not.<p>So what&#x27;s the solution you ask? As far as I can see it is to keep these companies from violating user&#x27;s rights by keeping them in line regardless of who owns or runs the company and regardless of whether those owners or proprietors are cooperative on other fronts. Assuming that these laws were written to stem the negative influence these app-things have on their users they should have gone after many other companies much earlier. Had they done so it might even have led to TikTok realising that their scheme would not work in the EU. They might not have launched here or they might have detuned their algorithmic user trap, they might have done many things to negate the negative effects of their product. They might just have decided to skip the whole EU market altogether like many other companies have done and do. I&#x27;d have thought &#x27;good riddance&#x27;, what you?",
