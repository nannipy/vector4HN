  "article_text": "Kirkville - I Now Assume that All Ads on Apple News Are Scams Skip to content In 2024, Apple signed a deal with Taboola to serve ads in its app, notably Apple News. John Gruber, writing in Daring Fireball said at the time: If you told me that the ads in Apple News have been sold by Taboola for the last few years, I\u2019d have said, \u201cOh, that makes sense.\u201d Because the ads in Apple News\u2009\u2014\u2009at least the ones I see1\u2009\u2014\u2009already look like chumbox Taboola ads. Even worse, they\u2019re incredibly repetitious. I use Apple News to keep up on topics that I don\u2019t find in sources I pay for (The Guardian and The New York Times). But there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to pay the exorbitant price Apple wants for Apple News+ \u2013 \u00a313 \u2013 because, while you get more publications, you still get ads. And those ads have gotten worse recently. Many if not most of them look like and probably are scams. Here are a few examples from Apple News today. Here are three ads that are scammy; the first two were clearly generated by AI, and the third may have been created by AI. Why are they scams? When I searched domain information for the domains, I found that they were registered very recently. Domain Name: MUSTYLEVO.COM Registry Domain ID: 3059688301_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.gname.com Registrar URL: http://www.gname.com Updated Date: 2026-02-04T07:23:58Z Creation Date: 2026-01-21T07:23:43Z Domain Name: SOLVERACO.COM Registry Domain ID: 3045027870_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: grs-whois.hichina.com Registrar URL: http://wanwang.aliyun.com Updated Date: 2025-12-05T06:10:51Z Creation Date: 2025-12-05T06:07:40Z Domain Name: SHIYAATELIER.COM Registry Domain ID: 3037972202_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.name.com Registrar URL: http://www.name.com Updated Date: 2025-11-12T06:47:14Z Creation Date: 2025-11-12T06:47:13Z This recent registration doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are scams, but they don\u2019t inspire much confidence. Here\u2019s one example. This ad from Tidenox, whose website says I am retiring, showing a photo of an elderly woman, who says, \u201cFor 26 years, Tidenox has been port of your journey in creating earth and comfort at home.\u201d The image of the retiring owner is probably made by AI. ( Update : someone on Hacker News pointed out the partly masked Google Gemini logo on the bottom right. I hadn\u2019t spotted that, in part because I don\u2019t use any AI image generation tools.) These fake \u201cgoing out of business ads\u201d have been around for a few years, and even the US Better Business Bureau warns about them , as they take peoples\u2019 money then shut down. Does Apple care? Does Taboola care? Does Apple care that Taboola serves ads like this? My guess: no, no, and no. Note the registration date for the tidenox.com domain. It\u2019s nowhere near 26 years old, and it\u2019s registered in China: Domain Name: TIDENOX.COM Registry Domain ID: 2987356919_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: grs-whois.hichina.com Registrar URL: http://wanwang.aliyun.com Updated Date: 2025-05-29T09:17:31Z Creation Date: 2025-05-29T09:14:35Z Shame on Apple for creating a honeypot for scam ads in what they consider to be a premium news service. This company cannot be trusted with ads in its products any more.

While some magazines are tailored, many are just flat, low-res PDFs that look terrible on the high-end Retina screens Apple sells. Worst of all, Apple had the leverage to revolutionize a struggling industry; instead, they settled for a half-baked aggregator.<p>It\u2019s a toxic mix of Apple tropes that simply weren&#x27;t thought through.

Seems like the region where I live there&#x27;s a problem with gambling apps and, even if I&#x27;ve never used any app of this kind or showed interest in gambling sites&#x2F;platforms, I&#x27;m bombarded everyday by ads of gambling apps on YouTube.<p>Since last year, I&#x27;ve been reporting every gambling ad as &quot;Promoting illegal product&#x2F;service&quot; (they are, in fact, illegal here) to no avail, there&#x27;s no end to these ads nor seems like YouTube is willing to do anything but implement dark patterns to discourage reporting, such as delayed pop-ups when reporting to interrupt typing.<p>I noticed some time ago that others ads that seemed not related to gambling were also leading to gambling apps. They are categorized as anything, like Hotels, Banking, Cullinary and Education. Don&#x27;t look like YouTube checks if the things being advertised are really what they claim to be. It&#x27;s worse when you remember that kids also use YouTube a lot.",
